# s3funnel

This project is a clone of <https://github.com/shazow>'s s3funnel from google code: <http://code.google.com/p/s3funnel/>. s3funnel is a multithreaded command line tool for Amazon's Simple Storage Service (S3).

- Written in Python, easy_install the package to install as an egg.
- Supports multithreaded operations for large volumes. Put, get, or delete many items concurrently, using a fixed-size pool of threads.
- Built on workerpool for multithreading and boto for access to the Amazon S3 API.
- Unix-friendly input and output. Pipe things in, out, and all around.

      --put-acl=ACL     (`put` only) Set the ACL permission for each file
                [default: public-read]
      --put-full-path       (`put` only) Use the full given path as the key name,

### Create a bucket
    $ s3funnel mybukkit create
### List existing buckets
    $ s3funnel list
    mybukkit
### Put files in a bucket
    $ touch 1 2 3
    $ s3funnel mybukkit put 1 2 3
### List files in a bucket
    $ s3funnel mybukkit list
    1
    2
    3
### Copy files from a bucket
    $ rm 1 2 3
    $ s3funnel mybukkit get 1 2 3 --threads=2
    $ ls -1
    1
    2
    3
### Copy files from another bucket 
    $ s3funnel mybukkit_copy create
    $ s3funnel mybukkit list | s3funnel mybukkit_copy copy --source-bucket mybukkit --threads=2 
### Empty a bucket
    $ s3funnel mybukkit list | s3funnel mybukkit delete 
    $ s3funnel mybukkit_copy list | s3funnel mybukkit_copy delete --threads=2
### Delete a bucket 
    $ s3funnel mybukkit drop
